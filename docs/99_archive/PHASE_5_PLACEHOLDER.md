# Phase 5 — Execution & Expansion (Placeholder)

**Status:** RESERVED — NOT STARTED

## Purpose
Phase 5 is reserved for future system expansion once Phases 2–4 are complete and stable.

## Potential Scope (Non-binding)
- Frontend activation and visualization
- Opportunity surfacing and UX
- Scoring and ranking refinement
- Monitoring and observability UI
- Production hardening

## Constraints
- No Phase 5 work may override Phases 2–4
- All behavior must remain explainable and auditable
- Execution must remain opt-in

_No implementation is active in Phase 5._
