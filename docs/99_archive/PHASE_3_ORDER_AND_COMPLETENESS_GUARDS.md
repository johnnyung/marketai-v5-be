# PHASE 3 ORDER & COMPLETENESS GUARDS

Non-negotiable guards for Phase 3 execution.

---

## GUARD 1 — ORDER-INVARIANT OUTPUT
If outputs differ due to run ordering alone → INVALID.

---

## GUARD 2 — NO IMPLIED UNIVERSE
No engine may assume complete symbol coverage.

---

## GUARD 3 — NO IMPLIED RECENCY
Recency/priority must be explicit and bounded.

---

## GUARD 4 — PARTIAL IS NORMAL
Sparse or missing datasets are expected conditions.

---

## GUARD 5 — EXPLAINABLE SILENCE
Zero output requires reason codes (see silence canon).
