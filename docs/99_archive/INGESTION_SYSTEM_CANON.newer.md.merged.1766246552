## 🔒 Incident: Registry & Pipeline Desynchronization (Dec 2025)

### Root Cause
- Execution registry and metadata registry diverged
- Pipeline alternated between both
- Dist output lacked expected module files
- Context injection was inconsistent

### Symptoms
- Only 2–3 ingestion modules executed
- `mod.run is not a function`
- `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ticker')`
- Green build ≠ working runtime

### Canonical Resolution (LOCKED)
- One execution registry
- Static imports only
- Registry entries = `{ name, category, run }`
- Pipeline owns context construction
- UI registry is metadata-only

### Guardrails
- ENABLED module without `run(ctx)` = hard error
- Missing context = pipeline bug
- This document is the source of truth
