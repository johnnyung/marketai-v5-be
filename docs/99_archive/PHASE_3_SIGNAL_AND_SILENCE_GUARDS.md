# PHASE 3 SIGNAL & SILENCE GUARDS

These guards are NON-NEGOTIABLE.

---

## SIGNAL GUARDS
- Every signal must resolve to a canonical state
- NO_DATA must be preserved through evaluation
- Neutrality must be explicit, never assumed

---

## SILENCE GUARDS
- Zero output requires explicit reason codes
- Silence must be distinguishable from failure
- Validation treats silent silence as ERROR

---

## ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHY
Conservatism is acceptable.
Ambiguity without labeling is not.
