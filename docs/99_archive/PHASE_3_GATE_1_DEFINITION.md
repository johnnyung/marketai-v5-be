# PHASE 3 — GATE 1 DEFINITION (AUTHORITATIVE)

Gate 1 establishes the **structural intelligence skeleton**.
No scoring math, no rankings, no persistence.

---

## 1. GATE 1 PURPOSE

Gate 1 exists to:
- Prove interpretive flow correctness
- Enforce all Phase 3 canons
- Surface explainability paths
- Validate zero-opportunity behavior

Gate 1 does NOT optimize or judge value.

---

## 2. ALLOWED OUTPUTS (GATE 1)

Gate 1 MAY produce:
- Engine interfaces (conceptual)
- Execution ordering
- Signal state resolution paths
- Calendar decay application points
- Order-independence handling
- Silence detection + reason code emission
- Diagnostics / trace artifacts

All outputs may be EMPTY and still valid.

---

## 3. FORBIDDEN OUTPUTS (GATE 1)

Gate 1 must NOT include:
- Scoring weights or formulas
- Confidence aggregation
- Opportunity ranking
- Persistence to storage
- UI assumptions or formatting
- Performance optimization
- Heuristic tuning

Any of the above is a Gate violation.

---

## 4. REQUIRED CANON COMPLIANCE

Gate 1 MUST comply with:
- SIGNAL_STATE_SEMANTICS_CANON.md
- OPPORTUNITY_SILENCE_REASON_CODES.md
- CALENDAR_SIGNAL_SEMANTICS_CANON.md
- ENGINE_ORDER_INDEPENDENCE_CANON.md
- PHASE_3_READ_ONLY_DISCIPLINE_CANON.md

Failure to comply blocks progression.

---

## 5. VALID GATE 1 COMPLETION CRITERIA

Gate 1 is COMPLETE when:
- Engines resolve signals to canonical states
- NO_DATA is preserved, not collapsed
- Calendar signals decay correctly
- Partial / stale data is tolerated
- Zero-opportunity output emits reason codes
- Execution is order-invariant
- No Phase 2 artifacts were touched

Value judgment is NOT required.

---

## 6. ACCEPTABLE FAILURE MODES (GATE 1)

The following are acceptable in Gate 1:
- Zero opportunities
- All signals resolving to NO_DATA
- Diagnostics-only output
- High silence frequency

Silence without explanation is NOT acceptable.

---

## 7. EXIT CONDITION

Gate 1 may advance ONLY after:
- Gate 1 outputs are reviewed
- Compliance is confirmed
- Explicit authorization to begin Gate 2 is granted

No implicit progression allowed.
