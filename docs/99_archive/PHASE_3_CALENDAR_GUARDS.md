# PHASE 3 CALENDAR GUARDS

These guards are mandatory.

---

## GUARD 1 — EPISODIC ENFORCEMENT
Calendar signals must enter and exit relevance windows.

---

## GUARD 2 — NO RECENCY BIAS
Recent ≠ important.

---

## GUARD 3 — CONTEXT ONLY
Calendar signals modify interpretation; they do not create it.

---

## GUARD 4 — DECAY OR DROP
If decay cannot be established, the signal must resolve to NO_DATA.

---

## FAILURE MODE
Treating calendars as continuous signals is a Phase 3 violation.
