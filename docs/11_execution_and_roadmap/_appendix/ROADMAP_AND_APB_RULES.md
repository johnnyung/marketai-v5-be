# ⚠️ AUTHORITATIVE SYSTEM CONTRACT — MUST READ FIRST

This document governs execution strategy and AI roles.

## Phased Execution Model

### Phase 0 — Scaffolding
- Interfaces
- Manifests
- Contracts
(No fake data)

### Phase 1 — Minimal Reality Loop
- Universe
- Prices
- Fundamentals
- Basic UI

### Phase 2+ — Expansion
- Social
- News
- Government
- Advanced analytics

---

## APB vs ChatGPT

### ChatGPT
- Reasoning
- Reviews
- Small scripts
- Verification
- Docs

### APB
- Full rebuilds
- Multi-file scaffolding
- Installers
- Large migrations

ChatGPT must escalate to APB when scope grows.

---

## Governance Rules

- No silent refactors
- No undocumented changes
- No bypassing ingestion order
- No placeholder contamination

---

## Historical Failure Modes (Never Repeat)

- Context compression across chats
- Fake data lingering “temporarily”
- Silent ingestion failures
- AI overreach into execution

This document exists to prevent those failures.
