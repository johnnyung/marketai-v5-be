## Backend Contract Authority

This document (**BACKEND_CONTRACT_CANON.md**) is the **sole authoritative source** for:

- Backend API guarantees
- Runtime expectations
- Contract invariants
- Allowed and disallowed backend behavior

Rules:
- No other document may redefine backend contracts
- Frontend-facing documents are derivative
- If conflicts arise, this file always wins
