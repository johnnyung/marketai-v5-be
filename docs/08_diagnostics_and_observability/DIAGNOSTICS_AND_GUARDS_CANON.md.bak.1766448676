## Diagnostics & Guardrails Authority

This document (**DIAGNOSTICS_AND_GUARDS_CANON.md**) is the **sole authoritative source** for:

- Failure classification
- Guardrail philosophy
- Observability expectations
- Risk handling principles

Rules:
- All diagnostics behavior derives from this document
- No other file may redefine guardrail rules
- Canonical failure meaning is defined here

Supporting, non-authoritative documents live in:

## Canon Hygiene Notice — Duplicate Authority Block

This document may contain a duplicated "Diagnostics & Guardrails Authority" section above.
This duplication is **non-semantic**.

Rules:
- Treat the authority declaration as a single statement of truth
- Duplicated text does not create multiple tiers or multiple authorities
- If any inconsistency exists elsewhere, this canon still wins

## Ingestion Type Safety as Guardrail (Enforced)

TypeScript build failures in ingestion modules are intentional safeguards.

They prevent:
- Ambiguous ingestion outcomes
- Silent schema corruption
- Invalid status propagation

A module that fails to type-check:
- MUST NOT reach runtime
- MUST be corrected before ingestion resumes

Type safety is a guardrail, not friction.

## Engine Safety & Guardrails

- Expected analytical failures resolve to silence
- Structural contract violations hard-stop that engine only
- Synthetic or placeholder signals are forbidden
- Kill-switch and shadow modes prevent mutation
- Duplicate artifacts are suppressed deterministically
- Promotion gates act as overconfidence guards
