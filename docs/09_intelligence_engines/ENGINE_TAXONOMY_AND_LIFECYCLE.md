# MARKETAI V5 — ENGINE TAXONOMY & LIFECYCLE (CANONICAL)
🔒 Phase 7.11 — Locked

This document defines **all engines**, their roles, lifecycle position, and evolution contract.
It is the canonical reference for future AI sessions.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

> Engines are **isolated**, **independently evolvable**, and **phase-gated**.
> No engine may mutate state unless explicitly enabled.

## ENGINE TAXONOMY

### 1. Intelligence Bundles (ENABLED)
- Aggregates raw market signals
- Produces bundle-level evidence
- No decisions

### 2. Correlation Hunter (DISABLED)
- Finds multi-source alignment
- News + trades + policy + sentiment

### 3. Catalyst Hunter (DISABLED)
- Searches for triggering events
- Legislative, macro, earnings, filings

### 4. Engine Signals (DISABLED)
- Measures confidence, agreement, entropy
- Detects drift and instability

### 5. Risk Context (DISABLED)
- Downside modeling
- Historical failure analysis

### 6. AI Synthesis (DISABLED)
- Synthesizes all upstream engines
- Produces narrative + conviction

### 7. Opportunity Engine (ENABLED, SIMPLE)
- Converts synthesis into opportunities
- Entry / target / stop / confidence

### 8. Opportunity Lifecycle (DISABLED)
- Tracks outcomes over time
- Learns accuracy and decay

### 9. Correlation Artifacts (DISABLED)
- Stores explainability graphs
- Audit trails and evidence chains

## EVOLUTION CONTRACT

- Engines may be enhanced independently
- Engines must remain backward compatible
- New engines are DISABLED by default
- Registry is additive only

---

## FUTURE AI WORKFLOWS

Recommended enhancement cadence:
- 20 upgrades per engine
- Weekly source expansion
- Continuous deprecation of weak signals
- Confidence-weighted learning

---

## LOCK STATUS

- Registry: Locked
- Engine roles: Locked
- Lifecycle order: Locked
- Behavior: Expandable only

END.

## Intelligence Engine Authority Hierarchy

This document (**ENGINE_TAXONOMY_AND_LIFECYCLE.md**) is the **sole authoritative source** for:

- Engine existence
- Engine lifecycle order
- Enabled vs disabled state
- Phase gating and activation rules
- Evolution constraints

Rules:
- No other document may enable or disable engines
- No other document may redefine lifecycle order
- No other document may bypass phase locks

Supporting canonical documents exist for **structure, semantics, and scoring** only.

If conflicts arise, this document always wins.

## Engine Lifecycle Invariants

- Eligibility is determined per engine
- Mandatory inputs gate readiness
- Optional inputs must not block execution
- Partial evaluation is permitted
- Engines must be deterministic
- Shadow and live modes share logic
- Failures are isolated per engine
- Silence is a valid outcome
