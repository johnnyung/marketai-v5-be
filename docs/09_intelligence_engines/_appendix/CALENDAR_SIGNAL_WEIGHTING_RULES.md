# CALENDAR SIGNAL WEIGHTING RULES (PHASE 3)

Defines how calendar signals may influence confidence and ranking.

---

## 1. RELATIVE WEIGHT CLASS

Calendar signals are:
- Low base weight
- Context amplifiers only

They may never outweigh:
- Fundamental signals
- Market-derived signals
- Multi-source confirmations

---

## 2. CONDITIONAL AMPLIFICATION

Calendar signals MAY amplify when:
- Corroborated by non-calendar signals
- Temporally aligned with other catalysts

They may NEVER amplify in isolation.

---

## 3. MULTI-CALENDAR COLLISION

Multiple calendar events:
- Do NOT stack linearly
- Do NOT imply stronger direction
- May increase uncertainty instead

---

## 4. NEGATIVE CALENDAR CONTEXT

Calendar signals may be negative ONLY when:
- Event outcome contradicts expectations
- External confirmation exists

Calendar timing alone is not negative.
