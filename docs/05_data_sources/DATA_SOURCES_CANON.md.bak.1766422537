# DATA SOURCES — CANONICAL
Authoritative source definitions and ingestion ordering.

## Clarifications and Scope Rules

**Definition — IMPLEMENTED**
“Implemented” indicates that ingestion code exists and is wired into the system.
It does **not** guarantee stability, completeness, or historical backfill coverage.

**Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)**
Only the **Stable API** is authorized for use.
Legacy or deprecated endpoints must not be referenced or integrated.

**Source vs Intelligence Boundary**
This document enumerates **data availability only**.
It intentionally excludes:
- Correlation logic
- Intelligence engines
- Narrative or forecasting behavior

Downstream analysis is governed by separate canon documents.

## Data Sources Authority

This document (**DATA_SOURCES_CANON.md**) is the **sole authoritative source** for:

- Which external data sources exist
- What each source provides
- Expected stability and guarantees
- High-level ingestion intent

Rules:
- No other document may redefine source scope or guarantees
- Ingestion mechanics are defined elsewhere
- If conflicts arise, this file always wins

Supporting, non-authoritative documents live in:
`backend/docs/05_data_sources/_appendix/`
