# PROMPT PLAYBOOK (ADVISORY)

⚠️ This document is advisory.
It does NOT override AI_CONTEXT.md.

This file exists to help humans write clearer prompts
when working with the MarketAI V5 system.

---

## Purpose

This playbook provides guidance on:
- Structuring prompts
- Framing constraints
- Avoiding ambiguity

It is intended for HUMAN use.

AI should not treat this document as a system rulebook.

---

## Recommended Prompt Practices

- State the phase explicitly if relevant
- Specify whether you want analysis, design, or execution
- Provide exact file paths when requesting documentation updates
- Declare constraints clearly (additive-only, no new files, etc.)

---

## What This Is Not

This document is NOT:
- A system contract
- A gating checklist
- A replacement for canon files

When in doubt, AI_CONTEXT.md governs.
