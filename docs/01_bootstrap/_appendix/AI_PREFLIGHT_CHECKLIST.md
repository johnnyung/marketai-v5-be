# AI PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST (EXECUTION GATE)

⚠️ This checklist applies ONLY before producing executable output
(code, scripts, migrations, or doc rewrites).

It does NOT apply during analysis or discussion.

---

## Pre-Execution Verification

Before generating executable output, confirm:

- The current phase allows execution
- Target file paths exist and are writable
- Canon files have been provided
- Constraints are explicitly stated
- No assumptions are being made about system completeness

---

## Hard Stop Conditions

AI MUST STOP if:
- Phase is unclear
- Target files are not authorized
- Instructions conflict with canon
- Requested action violates scope

---

## Authority Reminder

AI_CONTEXT.md overrides this checklist.

This checklist exists to prevent accidental execution,
not to define system behavior.
